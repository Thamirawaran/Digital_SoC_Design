**Timing Modeling Using Delay Tables:**
Utilizing delay tables to model the propagation delays of logic gates and interconnects in the design.
These tables provide information on the delay experienced by signals as they propagate through various components in the circuit.

**Introduction to Timing Libraries and Steps to Include New Cell in Synthesis:**
Understanding timing libraries (also known as Liberty files) which contain timing information for standard cells.
Steps to include a new cell in synthesis involve characterization of the cell's timing behavior and updating the timing library with this information.

**Introduction to Delay Tables:**
Delay tables provide a comprehensive representation of delays associated with different input conditions and load capacitances for various standard cells.

**Delay Table Using Part 1:**
Part 1 of the delay table may include delay values for different input slew rates and output load capacitances.

**Delay Table Using Part 2:**
Part 2 of the delay table may include additional delay values for corner cases or non-standard conditions.

**Timing Analysis with Ideal Clocks Using OpenSTA:**
OpenSTA is a static timing analysis tool used to analyze the timing behavior of digital designs.
Ideal clock assumptions simplify timing analysis by assuming perfect clock signals without any jitter or uncertainty.

**Setup Timing Analysis and Introduction to Flip-Flop Setup Time:**
Setup timing analysis ensures that data signals stabilize before the clock edge arrives, considering the flip-flop setup time requirement.

**Introduction to Clock Jitter and Uncertainty:**
Clock jitter refers to the variation in the arrival time of clock signals, which can impact the timing behavior of the design.
Uncertainty accounts for variations in process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) conditions that affect timing.

**Clock Tree Synthesis TritonCTS and Signal Integrity:**
TritonCTS is a clock tree synthesis tool used to design efficient clock distribution networks while considering signal integrity issues such as skew and jitter.

**Clock Tree Routing and Buffering Using H-Tree Algorithm:**
The H-tree algorithm is a common technique used in clock tree routing to minimize skew and ensure balanced clock distribution by hierarchically branching clock signals.

**Crosstalk and Clock Net Shielding:**
Crosstalk refers to unwanted coupling between adjacent signal lines, which can lead to timing violations and signal integrity issues.
Shielding techniques are employed to mitigate crosstalk effects on critical clock nets.

**Timing Analysis with Real Clocks Using OpenSTA:**
Real clock analysis involves considering clock jitter and other real-world factors in timing analysis to accurately predict circuit behavior.

**Setup Timing Analysis Using Real Clocks:**
Timing analysis considering real clocks ensures that setup time requirements are met under realistic operating conditions.

**Hold Timing Analysis Using Real Clocks:**
Hold timing analysis ensures that data signals remain stable after the clock edge, considering clock skew and setup time violations under real clock conditions.
