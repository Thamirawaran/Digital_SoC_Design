**Floorplan steps:**
1. Determine the dimensions (width and height) of the core and die area.
2. Establish locations for IO pad sites to accommodate input-output connections.
3. Arrange the placement of macros, which are pre-designed functional blocks, within the layout.
4. Generate rows for standard cell placement, ensuring efficient use of space for logic elements.
5. Conduct power planning activities before routing to optimize power distribution across the layout.
6. Integrate physical-only cells into the design as needed for specialized functions.
7. Position blockages strategically to reserve space for specific components or avoid interference between elements.
