**Chip**: In VLSI, a chip refers to the physical piece of semiconductor material on which integrated circuits are fabricated. It contains multiple electronic 	components such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and interconnects, all integrated onto a single substrate. Chips can vary greatly in complexity, ranging from simple logic gates to complex microprocessors. 

**Pads**: Pads are the interface between the integrated circuit and the external world. They are the connection points through which signals are inputted or outputted from the chip. Pads typically consist of metal areas on the chip's surface to which external connections (e.g., wires or solder bumps) are made. They are crucial for connecting the chip to the package and subsequently to the circuit board.

**Core**: In VLSI design, a core refers to a predefined and reusable block of circuitry that performs a specific function. Cores can range from simple functional units like adders or multipliers to more complex modules like processors or memory blocks. Designing with cores allows for faster development and higher reliability since these components are thoroughly tested and characterized.

**Die**: A die is a single unit of a semiconductor wafer that contains one or more individual integrated circuits. During the fabrication process, multiple copies of the same integrated circuit design are patterned onto a semiconductor wafer. Each of these individual copies, once separated from the wafer, is referred to as a die. Dies are then packaged individually to create discrete integrated circuit components.

**IPs (Intellectual Properties)**: IPs in VLSI refer to pre-designed and pre-verified functional blocks or modules that can be integrated into a larger chip design. These blocks are often designed by third-party companies specializing in semiconductor IP, and they can include cores, memory blocks, interface controllers, and other complex functions. Integrating IPs into a chip design allows designers to leverage existing, proven functionality, saving time and effort in the design process.

**1. CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing):**
- CISC architectures are characterized by a large and diverse set of complex instructions.
- Instructions in CISC architectures often perform multiple low-level operations in a single instruction.
- These architectures typically have variable-length instructions, where some instructions may be quite long.
- CISC architectures tend to have more emphasis on hardware complexity to support a wide range of instructions.
- Examples of CISC architectures include x86 (Intel and AMD processors) and many older processor architectures.

**2. RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing):**

- RISC architectures have a smaller, simpler set of instructions compared to CISC architectures.
- Instructions in RISC architectures generally perform one simple operation each.
- RISC architectures typically have fixed-length instructions, simplifying instruction decoding and pipelining.
- RISC architectures rely more on optimizing compilers to convert high-level code into efficient sequences of simpler instructions.
- RISC architectures often have a simpler hardware design, which can lead to improved performance and lower power consumption.
- Examples of RISC architectures include ARM, MIPS, and PowerPC.

<!---**SKY L3 - From Software Applications to Hardware:** This likely refers to a process or system where software applications are translated into hardware functionality. It could involve converting high-level programming instructions into hardware operations.--->

**Higher Level Language:** These are programming languages like Python or C++ that are designed to be easy for humans to read and write. They abstract away low-level details and provide features that make programming more intuitive and efficient.

**Compiler:** A compiler is a software tool that translates code written in a high-level programming language (like Python or C++) into a lower-level language, typically assembly language or machine code, which is closer to the language that the computer's hardware can execute directly.

**Assembler:** An assembler is a program that translates assembly language code into machine code, which consists of binary instructions (0s and 1s) that can be directly executed by the processor. It bridges the gap between human-readable assembly code and the actual instructions that the hardware understands.

**Operating System (OS):** The operating system is a software layer that manages hardware resources and provides services to applications. It abstracts away hardware complexities, handles tasks such as memory management, file system operations, and input/output operations, and ensures that multiple applications can run concurrently on the hardware without interfering with each other.

**ASIC Design Flow:**
ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design flow is the process of creating custom integrated circuits tailored to specific applications.
It involves several stages from conceptualization to physical implementation, including design entry, logic synthesis, physical design, verification, and manufacturing.


**RTL to GDSII Flow:**
RTL (Register Transfer Level) to GDSII (Graphic Data System II) flow is the process of transforming a Register Transfer Level design description into a physical layout ready for manufacturing.
It includes synthesis, floor planning, power planning, placement, routing, and sign-off stages.

**Synthesis:**
Synthesis is the process of translating RTL code into a gate-level representation using logic gates from a standard cell library.
It optimizes the design for area, timing, and power constraints.

**Floor Planning:**
Floor planning involves partitioning the chip's area into functional blocks and allocating resources like logic cells, memory, and I/O pads.
It considers factors such as power distribution, signal routing, and clock tree placement.

**Power Planning:**
Power planning ensures adequate distribution of power and ground across the chip to meet dynamic and static power requirements.
It involves determining the location of power pads, power rails, and optimizing power distribution network (PDN) to minimize voltage drop and noise.

**Placement:**
Placement assigns physical locations to synthesized logic cells on the chip's floorplan.
It aims to minimize wire length, optimize timing, and fulfill design constraints.

**Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):**
CTS involves synthesizing a clock distribution network to deliver clock signals with minimal skew and jitter to all sequential elements (flip-flops) in the design.
It ensures synchronous operation and timing closure.

**Routing:**
Routing involves determining the physical paths of wires to connect the placed cells according to the design's connectivity requirements.
It optimizes for signal integrity, congestion, and manufacturability.

**Sign-off:**
Sign-off includes a series of verification steps to ensure that the design meets specifications and is ready for fabrication.
It involves physical verification (DRC, LVS), timing analysis (STA), power analysis, and reliability checks.

**OpenLane ASIC Flow:**
OpenLane is an open-source ASIC flow developed by Efabless and Google.
It provides a complete RTL to GDSII flow using open-source tools and libraries.
It automates many steps of the ASIC design flow, making it accessible to a wider audience and reducing design time and cost.
