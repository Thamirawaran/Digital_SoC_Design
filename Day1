Chip: In VLSI, a chip refers to the physical piece of semiconductor material on which integrated circuits are fabricated. It contains multiple electronic components such as 
      transistors, resistors, capacitors, and interconnects, all integrated onto a single substrate. Chips can vary greatly in complexity, ranging from simple logic gates to complex microprocessors.

Pads: Pads are the interface between the integrated circuit and the external world. They are the connection points through which signals are inputted or outputted from the chip. 
      Pads typically consist of metal areas on the chip's surface to which external connections (e.g., wires or solder bumps) are made. They are crucial for connecting the chip to 
      the package and subsequently to the circuit board.

Core: In VLSI design, a core refers to a predefined and reusable block of circuitry that performs a specific function. Cores can range from simple functional units like adders or 
      multipliers to more complex modules like processors or memory blocks. Designing with cores allows for faster development and higher reliability since these components are 
      thoroughly tested and characterized.

Die: A die is a single unit of a semiconductor wafer that contains one or more individual integrated circuits. During the fabrication process, multiple copies of the same 
      integrated circuit design are patterned onto a semiconductor wafer. Each of these individual copies, once separated from the wafer, is referred to as a die. Dies are then 
      packaged individually to create discrete integrated circuit components.

IPs (Intellectual Properties): IPs in VLSI refer to pre-designed and pre-verified functional blocks or modules that can be integrated into a larger chip design. These blocks are 
      often designed by third-party companies specializing in semiconductor IP, and they can include cores, memory blocks, interface controllers, and other complex functions. Integrating 
      IPs into a chip design allows designers to leverage existing, proven functionality, saving time and effort in the design process.
